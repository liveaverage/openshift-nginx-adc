## File Structure

To achieve this separation, we create a configuration layout that supports a multi‑purpose NGINX Plus instance and provides a convenient structure for automating configuration deployment through CI/CD pipelines. The resulting directory structure under `/etc/nginx` looks like this:

 ...
etc/
├── nginx/
│    ├── conf.d/……………………………………………………………… Subdirectory for other HTTP configurations (Web │server, load balancing, etc.)
│    │   └── default.conf ……………………………
│    ├── includes/ proxy_headers

│    ├── fastcgi_params
│    ├── koi-utf
│    ├── koi-win
│    ├── mime.types
│    ├── scgi_params
